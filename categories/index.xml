			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Internship that I was so excited about in the late 2K19 is finally over and I’m back here again to share my learnings. Even though my job profile stated “Software Engineer”, it was quite different from traditional software engineering because I was part of the &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure team&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who says you can&amp;rsquo;t time travel? I&amp;rsquo;m glad to tell you that there are ways to hack the system. When I was 19-Year-Old, I found the concept of writing a letter to your future self very intriguing. I wanted to try it out, so I decided that on every birthday I’d write a letter to myself, that I’d open on my next birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;For years I have known that privacy is a myth and has become a defunct concept. All the tech giants who are in active-pursuit to control the Internet have made sure that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to care about privacy. But then one day I stumbled upon this podcast that made me realize that the majority is unaware of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;No doubt, changes are inevitable. The person who resists the changes that are for his/her good is no better than a dead person. I had to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
