    <p>No doubt, changes are inevitable. The person who resists the changes that are for his/her good is no better than a dead person. I had to make a change.</p>
<p>This is the change that every blogger makes sooner or later. I have decided to move to my own space. It&rsquo;s nothing fancy, simple enough to make me feel that I&rsquo;m in control of my content. Before moving here, I started by writing articles on <a href="https://abhitaker.wordpress.com/"><strong>wordpress</strong></a> from 2017. Then I moved to <a href="https://medium.com/@abhitaker"><strong>medium</strong></a>, wrote a bunch of articles there and now here I am.</p>
<p>Before moving on to a new journey, I would like to reminisce about the blog posts that I enjoyed writing and the articles that matter the most for me. Most of the things that I&rsquo;ve written lately is purely based on my past experiences and few future articles are also going to be on the similar lines until I run out of things. but before talking about the future, let me rank my top 3 picks from Wordpress, in no particular order.</p>
<h3 id="journey-to-acmhttpsabhitakerwordpresscom20181020journey-to-the-acm-i"><a href="https://abhitaker.wordpress.com/2018/10/20/journey-to-the-acm-i/">JOURNEY TO ACM</a></h3>
<p><strong>ACM</strong> (coding club) is something that is and will always remain close to my heart. I always thought of it as a platform using which I could make some impact on the coding culture of the college. was I able to make some impact? who knows, I know I tried.</p>
<p>It is also a place where I came in contact with many awesome seniors. This post was a 2 part series in which I wrote about how I made it to the club and it still gives me goosebumps to think about those times.</p>
<h3 id="interview-timehttpsabhitakerwordpresscom20171214interview-time"><a href="https://abhitaker.wordpress.com/2017/12/14/interview-time/">InterView Time</a></h3>
<p>This was the first time I had an interview experience and how could I not write about it. This experience played an important role in changing my perception of a few things</p>
<h3 id="hack-in-the-northhttpsabhitakerwordpresscom20180507hack-in-the-north-i"><a href="https://abhitaker.wordpress.com/2018/05/07/hack-in-the-north-i/">HACK IN THE NORTH</a></h3>
<p>Another 2 part series, that covered my experience of attending a National Hackathon for the first time. My team won the 2nd prize. I made friends with some pretty cool seniors and it was an amazing experience overall.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now the question is what am I planning to write in the future?</p>
<p>I want to provide some value through my blogs and the main focus would be on that. Rest, I hope you keep finding my blog helpful.</p>
