                "body": "Who says you can\u0026rsquo;t time travel? I\u0026rsquo;m glad to tell you that there are ways to hack the system. When I was 19-Year-Old, I found the concept of writing a letter to your future self very intriguing. I wanted to try it out, so I decided that on every birthday I‚Äôd write a letter to myself, that I‚Äôd open on my next birthday.\nIn that pursuit, my 19-Year-Old self decided to write a letter for me and I\u0026rsquo;m glad he did that. I felt it was quite a motivating message and I thought it would be interesting to share this with everyone.\nThe Letter  congrats on turning 22 today, this is your 19-year-old self. I hope you have come a long way from where you started. I hope you are still optimistic about your future. Right now it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what has happened in the past. I hope you have recovered from all the failures and heartbreaks \u0026amp; learned from them. I just want to tell you, that I believe in you, that you will make everything thing right and if everything is already right for you, you\u0026rsquo;ll help others to make it right for them üôÇ\nI want you to recollect all your energy and be as enthusiastic as I am while writing this, if possible, even more. it\u0026rsquo;s not the time to be exhausted, it\u0026rsquo;s where you revolutionize your life, turn it upside down, become more stupid, take more challenges. Your current life might be very different from what I imagined for you but I want to tell you something, life is not what you imagine, it is what you experience and I want you to try out many things.\nmany things might have changed in your life and I hope you have dealt with them accordingly, but even if you made some mistakes that is fine with me, as long as you have thought through and rectified them. I will not lecture you on how to go through your career because I know you would have already figured it out ( because this is what I am good at, figuring things out üòõ ) and I know it\u0026rsquo;s best for you \u0026amp; me.\nand I would be really really disappointed if you didn\u0026rsquo;t travel much. I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t disappoint me in this domain. I hope you have made many more connections in these years and ready to make some new ones. so let\u0026rsquo;s start our new journey with a blast. In the end, I have 4 words for you: STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH\n  If in some parallel universe my 19-Year-Old self could see his future, I hope he‚Äôs satisfied with what he goes on to accomplish.\n   On a side note, we are having great deal of discussion on mental health but no one\u0026rsquo;s providing a good framework to excercise it. I would encourage everyone to try something on these lines. It\u0026rsquo;s extremely therapeutic and provides a good framework to track your emotional growth.\nEveryone makes progress in life but if it aligns with your vision for you, the feeling of satisfaction and happiness rises to another level. whenever you are happy, try to capture those moments in your own words and in tough times turn to these words and try to relieve all such happy moments again. It would make you believe that tough times doesn\u0026rsquo;t lasts long and things always gets better üôÇ\n"

                "body": "For years I have known that privacy is a myth and has become a defunct concept. All the tech giants who are in active-pursuit to control the Internet have made sure that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to care about privacy. But then one day I stumbled upon this podcast that made me realize that the majority is unaware of this fact.\n        This podcast features Edward Snowden who emphasizes the fact of how we have been stripped away from our right to privacy without our permission and were made to believe that it was for our benefit. This video had a big impact on how I perceived my privacy. I followed it up by reading his autobiography, Permanent Record, which was a perfect book for a geeky person such as myself. He talks about what motivated him to build and operate a huge surveillance network for his country, which is now used to spy and store records of every single person on the planet. I highly recommend watching this podcast and reading this awesome book. Most of the facts that I‚Äôm going to share here in this blog post were derived from them. My main motive here is to acquaint or inform you how deadly this breach of your privacy is, how it‚Äôs done and what potential repercussion it can have in the near future. You‚Äôd be surprised to know how you get compromised every day in various ways and what those hundred of user agreements, you\u0026rsquo;ve knowingly and unknowingly agreed to, actually means.\nIf you feel that you are being watched, monitored or tracked every day, you are not wrong. I can assure you that it‚Äôs being done. Maybe you are not a threat, but who gets to decide the definition of threat? We get spied on every day, we get tracked, our data on social media is exploited, our call records are stored, our sentiments are analyzed and we are looked as a product by businesses and as a threat by the Intelligence.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s my moral obligation to make a conscious effort in bringing this to your attention and then you can decide whether to take heed or not.\nWhy Should I Care? Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve turned 50 in 2050 and you are running for President or Prime Minister. Just before a week of elections some of the insensitive content, that you had posted on the Internet when you were a stupid teenager, resurfaced. Even though you had deleted that content as soon as you posted it, you don\u0026rsquo;t know how it still exists. Well, welcome to the 21st Century, where your data is going to persist as long as the human race is alive. The worst of it all, your data lies with the Intelligence and business organizations who are under no obligation to keep it secure and more often than not, it is used against you.\nAlso Imagine you‚Äôre in 2030, where you are being ranked in a society based on your track record on the Internet and all the regular monitoring that is being done. Your points get deducted each time you break a rule like searching some prohibited things on web, trying to cross the road on red light or for any action deemed socially unacceptable by your government. If your total points fall below a certain threshold, you‚Äôd be socially isolated. This does seem like one of a Black mirror‚Äôs episodes, but some extent of it is already happening in a few countries, believe it or not.\nHere is an interesting excerpt from Snowden‚Äôs book:\n‚Äúif something can be done, it probably will be done, and possibly already has been‚Äù.\nHow do we give away our data? If I got a penny for every time I scrolled down a user-agreement without reading a single word, I would be a millionaire. I bet 100% of us, at one time or the other avoided reading the content of this long-boring thing. This ignorance of us is then exploited to make us agree to their terms and conditions, and even provide some, the permission to track our behaviour. This is our fault but no conscious efforts are ever made by the businesses to put forth these user agreements in more user friendly format. These are examples of the few agreement terms that you agree to:\n    Google\u0026#39;s User Agreement        Facebook\u0026#39;s User Agreement       Why is Facebook following me on some random site?     This is just the tip of the iceberg. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs against the law, what I‚Äôm asking is, Are you aware of this? Some organizations keep your data and creates your shadow profile even if you never signed up for their services. So if you are sharing your photos, videos or any of the private stuff without paying for it, just know that it‚Äôs not free. I‚Äôm sure they are secure from the outside world, but how do we know who they consider the outsider and who is the insider?\nAnother important fact you should know is that it‚Äôs not only the data that we consciously agree to share, is used. It‚Äôs the data that can be derived from that data, called metadata, which is more threatening. Where are you most likely to be located at midnight? whom you are most likely to give a call in the evening? what can most likely scare you? How can you be convinced to do something? when you are most likely to go out and grab a burger? These are a few questions that can potentially be answered through your metadata.\nThen there are things that we have never agreed to like face-recognition and monitoring through public CCTVs, which is being actively done and then combined to take the tracking stuff to the next level. Even your cell-phone is listening to you in the background. Try saying Ok Google, Hey Siri or Hey Alexa.\nAnother way I think about all this is, tomorrow they are going to build a super-smart Artificial Intelligence that would have access to all my data (pics, posts, messages, videos, etc), because I\u0026rsquo;ve consciously or unconsciously agreed to it while saying yes to those user agreements. That thing is going to know me from the inside out. From my fears to my failures, my weakness, my sentiments, and whatnot. This certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be a comfortable thing to deal with.\nThis post has already become huge. I was hoping to share many more insights on how our actions on the web are tied to our Identity, to monitor our behavior. It‚Äôs a topic for another blog but the first step to solve an issue is to identify that it\u0026rsquo;s an issue. I hope I‚Äôve ignited enough spark in you to do your probing on this topic but here is the thing:\nThe Internet is something that is now part of everyone\u0026rsquo;s life 24x7.\nI know they say Ignorance is Bliss, but if something of this level is at stake, Ignorance can be fatal. Be more conscious and cautious of the actions taken by authority/businesses on matters related to online privacy and try to mitigate the grave dangers that the Internet poses through knowledge. At least try to understand this thing called the Internet, so you can comprehend the repercussions of your actions.\n"

I had to make a change.\nThis is the change that every blogger makes sooner or later. I have decided to move to my own space. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing fancy, simple enough to make me feel that I\u0026rsquo;m in control of my content. Before moving here, I started by writing articles on wordpress from 2017. Then I moved to medium, wrote a bunch of articles there and now here I am.\nBefore moving on to a new journey, I would like to reminisce about the blog posts that I enjoyed writing and the articles that matter the most for me. Most of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve written lately is purely based on my past experiences and few future articles are also going to be on the similar lines until I run out of things. but before talking about the future, let me rank my top 3 picks from Wordpress, in no particular order.\nJOURNEY TO ACM ACM (coding club) is something that is and will always remain close to my heart. I always thought of it as a platform using which I could make some impact on the coding culture of the college. was I able to make some impact? who knows, I know I tried.\nIt is also a place where I came in contact with many awesome seniors. This post was a 2 part series in which I wrote about how I made it to the club and it still gives me goosebumps to think about those times.\nInterView Time This was the first time I had an interview experience and how could I not write about it. This experience played an important role in changing my perception of a few things\nHACK IN THE NORTH Another 2 part series, that covered my experience of attending a National Hackathon for the first time. My team won the 2nd prize. I made friends with some pretty cool seniors and it was an amazing experience overall.\n Now the question is what am I planning to write in the future?\nI want to provide some value through my blogs and the main focus would be on that. Rest, I hope you keep finding my blog helpful.\n"
