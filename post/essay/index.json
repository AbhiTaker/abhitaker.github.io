I had to make a change.\nThis is the change that every blogger makes sooner or later. I have decided to move to my own space. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing fancy, simple enough to make me feel that I\u0026rsquo;m in control of my content. Before moving here, I started by writing articles on wordpress from 2017. Then I moved to medium, wrote a bunch of articles there and now here I am.\nBefore moving on to a new journey, I would like to reminisce about the blog posts that I enjoyed writing and the articles that matter the most for me. Most of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve written lately is purely based on my past experiences and few future articles are also going to be on the similar lines until I run out of things. but before talking about the future, let me rank my top 3 picks from Wordpress, in no particular order.\nJOURNEY TO ACM ACM (coding club) is something that is and will always remain close to my heart. I always thought of it as a platform using which I could make some impact on the coding culture of the college. was I able to make some impact? who knows, I know I tried.\nIt is also a place where I came in contact with many awesome seniors. This post was a 2 part series in which I wrote about how I made it to the club and it still gives me goosebumps to think about those times.\nInterView Time This was the first time I had an interview experience and how could I not write about it. This experience played an important role in changing my perception of a few things\nHACK IN THE NORTH Another 2 part series, that covered my experience of attending a National Hackathon for the first time. My team won the 2nd prize. I made friends with some pretty cool seniors and it was an amazing experience overall.\n Now the question is what am I planning to write in the future?\nI want to provide some value through my blogs and the main focus would be on that. Rest, I hope you keep finding my blog helpful.\n"
